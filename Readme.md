# Auth 

#### Imagine a cool mobile app I made to show off my skills in keeping apps safe. It's built to demonstrate how I handle user logins effectively.
This app uses Firebase, a helpful tool for managing user data. It lets users log in securely and see stuff personalized just for them. 
With Firebase, the app handles logins smoothly, storing user info safely for when they come back later.

While making the app look super fancy wasn't my main goal, I focused on showing I understand how to keep user info safe and make logins work smoothly. 
It's my way of saying I'm serious about learning and getting better at making mobile apps, especially when it comes to keeping them safe and easy to use.
